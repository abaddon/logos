"""Logos types: the vocabulary and the syntax that names it.

A type is a frozen value. Equality is structural for the composites and
nominal for ``StructRef``/``EnumRef``, which compare by name; once a name is
resolved, :func:`compatible` also requires that both sides name a type the same
module declared, because two modules may each declare a ``point``. There is no
subtyping and no conversion: :func:`compatible` answers "is this the same
type", never "can this become that", so a width or a signedness never changes
under it. A ``TypeVar`` is not a wildcard: it compares by name like any other
type. Generics do not make it one — the checker *unifies* a parameter against
an argument to bind the variable, and :func:`substitute` replaces each bound
variable by the one concrete type the call chose. Equality itself stays exact,
so a value never changes kind under it.

Named types are written bare and primitives are written with a colon, matching
``(res :i64 parse-error)``: the colon marks the closed built-in vocabulary, so
``:point`` is an unknown primitive, not a reference to ``point``. An atom that
is a single capital letter names a type variable, and so does the same letter
behind the colon: ``T`` and ``:T`` are one type, because a single capital is
the one word in the primitive vocabulary that is not a primitive.

:func:`parse_type` is pure syntax. It validates primitives, because that list
is closed and needs no module to know, but it leaves a bare name as a
``StructRef`` for the checker to resolve or reject: only the checker knows
which types a module declares. Every diagnostic it raises takes an optional
``path`` so a caller holding a bare ``Token`` (which has no path of its own)
can still locate the error at the form that owns the token.
