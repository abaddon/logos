"""Lower a checked module to the IR.

Scope
-----
This pass lowers what the check accepts: integer literals, ``let``/``letmut``
and ``set``, ``ret``, calls, ``if``, ``while``, ``match``, ``break``/
``continue``, comparisons, ``and``/``or``/``not``, ``print``/``println`` over
every printable scalar, checked integer division, structs (``make``, ``get``,
``set-field``), fixed arrays (``make``, ``arr-get``, ``arr-set``), strings
(``str-len``, ``str-concat``, ``str-eq``, ``str-slice``), vectors
(``make``, ``vec-push``, ``vec-len``, ``vec-get``, ``vec-set``, ``vec-free``)
and the tagged values of results and optionals (``ok``, ``err``, ``some``,
``none``, ``try``), and threads with their synchronization (``spawn``,
``join``, ``mutex``, ``lock``, ``unlock``, ``chan``, ``send``, ``recv``,
``atomic``, ``atomic-add``, ``atomic-load``, ``atomic-store``). A construct the
checker accepts but this pass does not lower yet is reported as a diagnostic at
its own path — never a ``KeyError`` or a ``ValueError``, and never silently
miscompiled.

Results, optionals and enums
----------------------------
A result is ``{ i1, T, E }`` and an optional is ``{ i1, T }``: the tag first,
then one slot per variant. ``(ok v)`` writes the tag and the ok slot,
``(err e)`` the tag and the error slot, the unused slot staying ``undef``;
``(some v)`` and ``(none)`` are the same shape with one slot. A ``match`` over
one extracts the tag, tests it with a single ``icmp``, and reads the payload
with ``extractvalue`` — no memory round trip, because both payloads are fields.

``(try e)`` is the one form that returns: it tests the tag, and on the error
path builds an ``(err e)`` of the *enclosing function's* return type and
executes ``ret`` from the new block. The checker has already proved the two
error types are the same enum, so the payload carries across unchanged. The ok
path extracts the payload and continues in the block the expression was
written in, which is what lets ``(try ...)`` sit inside a longer expression.

An enum is ``{ i32, [K x i64] }`` — a tag and a payload area wide enough for
its widest variant, so every variant is one LLVM type and a value passes
between functions without a new type per variant. ``K`` is registered by the
enclosing declaration, like a struct's field list, and ``sizeof_of`` uses the
same rule. A variant with a payload is built in a stack slot: the tag stored at
field 0, the payload at the first byte of the area through a bitcast pointer,
then the slot loaded as a value. A variant without one is a single
``insertvalue`` of its tag. Binding a payload in an arm reverses that: the
value is stored, the area re-read through a pointer of the variant's own type
and the result bound to a fresh slot. The tag is what makes the different
interpretations safe — only the arm whose test passed reads the area.

Structs and arrays
------------------
A struct is an LLVM identified type whose fields are printed in declaration
order, ``%struct.point = type { i64, i64 }``, which is C's layout: LLVM pads
and aligns an identified struct exactly as C does for the same field list. A
``make`` builds the aggregate as a value with one ``insertvalue`` per field;
``get`` reads one field with ``extractvalue``, so a struct can be nested,
passed, returned and stored without ever taking its address. ``set-field`` and
``arr-set`` mutate a binding in place: they take the binding's slot and store
through a ``getelementptr``. A fixed array is ``[n x T]``; ``arr-get`` spills a
non-binding operand into a slot (LLVM cannot index a value with a run-time
index), bounds-checks the index with one unsigned ``icmp`` and panics
``R0003`` before the ``gep`` and ``load``.

Only structs a function names are emitted, in dependency-first order: one it
materialises, one named in a signature (even only behind a pointer), in a
field, or in an array element. A declaration nothing uses is not emitted, so
it cannot fail a build over a field type this backend cannot spell. A struct
that points at itself is finite and gets one definition; the collection walk
stops at a pointer back to the struct being collected.

Values and slots
----------------
Every binding lives in a named stack slot, and every read of it is an explicit
``load`` into a fresh temporary. That is deliberately unoptimised: clang's
``-O2`` promotes the slots away, and until it does the IR shows one line per
source-level operation. A parameter is stored into its slot on entry, so a
parameter and a ``let`` are read the same way.

Every slot is allocated in the entry block, however deep in the source the form
that introduces it sits. ``alloca`` executes where it appears, so a binding
inside a loop body would otherwise grow the frame on every iteration and a long
loop would run out of stack; allocating once, in the block that runs once, is
what makes a ``let`` inside a loop free.

Binding visibility is block-scoped, matching the checker: the slot exists from
the entry block, but the name is known only inside the block that declared it
(an ``if`` branch, a ``while`` body, a ``match`` arm). Each block saves the
binding table on entry and restores it on exit, so a branch's ``let`` cannot
retarget a later read of the same outer name.

A declared type with no LLVM layout — ``(res T E)``, ``(opt T)`` and the rest
— is E0002 at the node that materialises it, never a ``ValueError`` from the
printer: the type vocabulary is larger than this backend, and the refusal must
carry a path. The walk descends through arrays, vectors *and* pointers, so a
struct behind a ``(ptr T)`` cannot hide a field this backend cannot spell. A
struct, an array or a vector is lowerable when every type inside it is; an enum
is not, until results arrive.

Control flow
------------
``if`` and ``match`` are expressions, so each writes its branch's value into a
result slot and the join block loads it. A slot and a load, rather than a
``phi``, because a branch may end in a terminator (``ret``, ``break``) and a
``phi`` would then name an edge that does not exist; ``-O2`` turns the
slot back into a ``phi``.

``while`` is head/body/exit: the body branches back to the head, and the loop
stack gives ``break`` the exit label and ``continue`` the head label of the
innermost enclosing loop. A condition that is the literal ``true`` branches
straight to the body, with no head-to-exit edge: an exit block that no
``break`` can reach is closed with ``unreachable``, so a function whose
constant-true loop always returns is not reported as missing a ``ret``.
``match`` tests its arms' literals in source order and falls through to a panic
when no arm matches; ``and``/``or`` short-circuit, so the right operand of
``(and false (println "x"))`` never runs.

Concurrency
-----------
A thread, a mutex, a channel and an atomic are one opaque ``i8*`` at the C
boundary; generated code never looks inside one. ``spawn`` builds one heap
record holding the target's arguments (``rt_alloc`` under the spawn's own node
path, so an unjoined thread's handle is reportable at the form that started
it), emits a thunk ``i8* (i8*)`` per call site that unpacks the record and
calls the target, and hands both to ``rt_thread_new``. The runtime owns the
record and releases it when the target returns; ``join`` waits and releases the
handle. ``deref``, ``set-deref`` and ``ptr-add`` through a ``(shared (ptr T))``
are the same operations as through a ``(ptr T)``: the marker is a promise about
who else reaches the memory, not a different representation.

``send`` spills its value into a stack slot and passes the slot's address;
``recv`` gives the runtime a slot and loads what it filled. Both are one
runtime call, and both may block, which is why they are statements in practice
but remain expressions of type ``:void`` / ``T`` respectively. Every runtime
call that can fail carries the node path as a C literal, so R0005 names the
form that asked.

Names
-----
A binding is ``%v.<n>`` and its slot ``%v.<n>.addr``, numbered in declaration
order within the function; a temporary is ``%t<n>``. Source names never reach
the IR, because a Logos atom is not necessarily an LLVM identifier (``?``,
``/`` and non-ASCII are all legal in one), and a diagnostic that blamed the
``.ll`` for invalid text would be lying about where the bug is. Node paths do
not depend on binding names, so nothing else loses information.

A program function is emitted as ``internal @lg.<module>.<name>``; only
``main`` keeps its source name and external linkage. Without the mangle a Logos
``(fn write ...)`` would define ``@write`` and interpose on libc, so a program
calling ``println`` would write nothing.

Division
--------
``/`` and ``%`` are checked, never a bare ``sdiv``/``srem``. Before the
operation the divisor is compared with zero and a zero divisor calls
``rt_panic(path, "R0001", "division by zero")``: LLVM treats a division by zero
as undefined behaviour, so an unchecked one either traps at ``-O0`` or folds
the whole expression to poison at ``-O2``. For signed widths the one overflowing
pair, ``INT_MIN / -1``, takes a branch of its own and yields the wrapped result
without dividing. Unsigned widths use ``udiv``/``urem``.

Floats, shifts and casts
------------------------
A float operation is one IEEE instruction at ``:f32`` or ``:f64`` and nothing
else: ``fadd``/``fsub``/``fmul``/``fdiv``, and ``fcmp`` with the ordered
predicates (``une`` for ``!=``, so a NaN is unequal to everything, itself
included). No check precedes them and no fast-math flag follows them, so a float
division by zero produces ``inf`` or ``nan`` where the integer one panics, and
the two optimisation levels compute the same bits.

A shift masks its count to the operand's width with one ``and`` and then emits
``shl``, ``ashr`` (``shr``, the sign bit filling) or ``lshr`` (``shr-u``). The
mask is what makes a count of the width or more defined: LLVM calls that shift
poison, so leaving it in would let ``-O0`` and ``-O2`` disagree.

``(cast T e)`` lowers to the one instruction the two widths call for —
``trunc``/``sext``/``zext`` between integers, ``sitofp``/``uitofp``,
``fpext``/``fptrunc``, or ``fptosi``/``fptoui`` after a range test. The test
comes first because an out-of-range ``fptosi`` is undefined: a float outside the
target's range, or a NaN, panics ``R0003`` with the cast's own node path.

Strings
-------
A string literal becomes one private global holding exactly its bytes, shared
by every use of the same bytes, and the value of type ``:str`` is the aggregate
``{ i8*, i64 }`` the spec fixes: a pointer to those bytes and their byte count.
A literal builds it with two ``insertvalue`` steps from ``undef``; a ``:str``
parameter, return or binding carries the whole aggregate, so one string can be
passed through any number of functions without the pointer and the length
coming apart. ``print``/``println`` hand the two fields to ``rt_print_str``,
never a ``printf`` format: the length is the value's own, not a scan for a
terminator that was never written. A panic argument is the one exception: it is
a NUL-terminated C string, because ``rt_panic`` reads it with ``strlen``.

``str-len`` reads the length field and costs nothing else. ``str-slice`` builds
a view — the same buffer one ``gep`` along, with a shorter length — and copies
no bytes; it checks both bounds against the length and against each other with
three unsigned compares, then panics ``R0003``. ``str-concat`` is one call to
``rt_str_concat``, which allocates the result for the process's life: a
``:str`` owns nothing, so there is no one to hand the buffer back. ``str-eq``
and ``=``/``!=`` on ``:str`` are the same lowering: compare the lengths, and
only when they agree compare the bytes with ``memcmp``. ``!=`` inverts that
answer. ``read-all`` is one call to ``rt_read_all``, which reads standard input
to end of file into a buffer of the same kind: process-lifetime, untracked,
and released by nobody because no binding owns it.

Vectors
-------
A ``(vec T)`` is three words, ``{ T*, i64, i64 }``: the buffer, its length in
elements and its capacity. ``(make (vec T))`` builds the empty descriptor —
null buffer, two zero counts — and every read is an ``extractvalue`` of the
descriptor the binding holds.

``vec-push`` may have to grow, so it is the one form here with a control-flow
cost: it tests ``len == cap``, and on the full path allocates a new buffer with
``rt_alloc``, copies the live elements with ``memcpy``, releases the old buffer
with ``rt_free``, and joins with a ``phi`` carrying the new buffer and capacity.
Capacity goes to twice itself plus four, so the first push allocates four
elements and the copies a program pays for are logarithmic. Allocate and copy
rather than ``realloc`` because every block's record belongs to the leak
tracker: a buffer handed to ``realloc`` would leave the tracker describing an
address it no longer controls, and a freed buffer would look live. Growth also
checks that the new capacity is larger than the old one, so a wrapped value can
never pass as a bigger buffer.

The mutating forms — ``vec-push``, ``vec-set``, ``vec-free`` — name a place
whose slot holds the descriptor: a ``letmut`` binding or a parameter, both of
which have an alloca this function can write back into. ``vec-get`` and
``vec-len`` read any vector value, so a vector may be passed to a function and
read there, and a parameter is a place for the three mutating forms because
the callee owns what the caller moved into it — it is the one that has to be
able to release the buffer. ``vec-free`` releases the buffer and stores a
zeroed descriptor, which makes a second free release NULL and a later length
read zero.

Memory
------
``(alloc T n)`` becomes ``rt_alloc(bytes, align, path)`` — the byte count is
``n`` times the element's layout, the alignment is the element's own, and the
path is a compiler-generated C string the leak report prints at exit. The
result crosses the C boundary once, as ``i8*``, and is ``bitcast`` to ``T*``;
``(own T)`` and ``(ptr T)`` are both ``T*`` in the IR, because the difference
between them is what the checker knows, not what is stored.

``(deref p)`` is a typed ``load`` and ``(set-deref p v)`` a typed ``store``;
``(ptr-add p n)`` is a ``gep`` whose stride is the pointee's size. ``(ptr p)``
emits nothing at all: it is the same machine value under a type that cannot
free it. A move emits nothing either — the pointer is copied where the checker
allowed it and the old binding is never read again — so ownership costs no
instructions and the release is exactly the ``free`` the source spelled.

A debug build (a test build, by default) calls ``rt_leak_report`` on every path
out of ``main``, after the exit status is computed; a release build does not.
A debug build also defines ``LOGOS_DEBUG`` for the C runtime, which quarantines
every released block instead of returning it to malloc: a freed address then
cannot be recycled, so the double-free check in ``rt_free`` stays exact. The
runtime, not the compiler, decides what a live block is, which is why a double
free is caught there: a copy of a pointer the checker could not see — through
an aggregate, or from C — still reaches ``rt_free`` twice.

Generics
--------
A generic function has no body of its own here: the checker's copies do. Each
``Instance`` is lowered as its own function at ``lg.<module>.<name>$<type
arguments>`` — ``lg.m.map$i64$i64`` — with the copy's concrete parameters and
return type, and its own type record, so one source path can mean ``:i64`` in
one copy and ``:str`` in the next. A call site's copy is the one the checker
recorded for that path; anything else would be a second, silent instantiation
the checker never verified. A generic that no call reaches is not emitted at
all: there is no type to emit it at.

Closures
--------
``(fn :R ((p :T)...) body...)`` becomes a function of its own plus a value of
two words, ``{ i8*, i8* }``: the environment and the code. The code's address
is taken with ``faddr`` and the environment's with ``allocarec``/``geprec`` —
one stack slot holding a copy of each captured binding, written where the
expression appears and read through the pointer inside the closure. Stack, not
heap, because the language allocates nothing the source did not spell, and a
copy at creation is what "capture by value" means: a later ``set`` of the outer
binding reaches the binding, not the copy.

The environment therefore lives exactly as long as the frame that created it;
nothing here frees it, and nothing extends it. The checker refuses every form
that would let a capturing closure outlive its frame (E0502): returning it,
storing it in a field, an array or a vector, passing it to another function,
or keeping it past the loop iteration that made it. The one copy per
expression per frame is why the iteration rule exists, and the backend can
rely on the checker having applied it: no value it lowers reads a slot after
the frame that owns it. A capturing value has the type ``(fn* (T) R)``; a
``(fn (T) R)`` is a plain pointer with a null environment.

Calling one is indirect: the value is loaded, its two words are extracted, the
code pointer is ``bitcast`` to its real type — ``R (i8*, T...)``, the
environment first — and the call passes the environment ahead of the declared
arguments. A named function used as a value is the same pair with a null
environment, so both cross the boundary the same way.

Build sets
----------
A build set is lowered into one translation unit: one ``IrModule``, one string
table and one counter for generated names, because the object file is one.
Each module is lowered with its own type record and its own symbol map, so a
call into a sibling emits the sibling's symbol — ``lg.<module>.<name>`` —
whether it is written as a call, as a function value or as a ``spawn`` target.
The thunk a function value becomes calls the module that owns the body, not the
one that took its address.

A set of one module keeps bare struct and enum names, so its IR is exactly what
this backend produced before build sets existed. A set of several modules
spells a named type ``<module>.<name>``, because two roots may each declare a
private ``point`` and one LLVM identified type cannot stand for both. The
module named is the one that declared the type, which for an imported type is
its own module, not the one that used it.

        refuses a use of an identified type that is never defined. ``stack``
        holds the types currently being collected, so a pointer back to one of
        them stops there instead of walking forever: a struct that contains a
        pointer to itself is finite (``%struct.node = type { %struct.node* }``),
        unlike a struct that contains itself by value.

        An enum is collected through its payloads as well: an enum whose
        payload names a struct spells that struct's identified type inside the
        value, so the definition has to be emitted too. It has no definition
        line of its own — ``{ i32, [K x i64] }`` is a literal.

        The fields are read from the module that declares the struct and are
        spelled in that module's namespace as they are recorded, so a struct
        whose field names another module's ``point`` points at that module's
        definition rather than at a same-named copy of its own — and a field
