"""The sexpr tree and its node paths.

A file is a ``file`` node whose items are the top-level forms. Every form is a
``Node`` whose ``kind`` is its head atom; ``kind`` is the empty string for a
bare list such as a parameter list. ``items`` holds every child in source
order, head included, and each child is a ``Node`` or a ``Token``.

Paths
-----
Paths are strictly positional. A named definition inserts its own name:
``(mod math)`` is ``math``, ``(fn add ...)`` inside it is ``math/add``, and a
test inserts ``test/<name>`` so a test and a function may share a name
(``math/test/add`` against ``math/add``). The module form owns the file's
top-level namespace, so the other top-level forms are numbered from zero below
it: ``math/0``, ``math/1``.

Every other node appends its position among its parent's children, starting at
zero for the first item after the head, and after the name as well for a named
definition. No shape heuristic renumbers anything: the parameter list of
``(fn f :i64 ((a :i64)) ...)`` is ``m/f/1`` and so is the parameter list of
``(fn f (vec :i64) ((a :i64)) ...)``, and the single ``ret`` of
``(fn f :i64 ((a :i64)) (ret (+ a 1)))`` is ``m/f/2``. Tokens occupy a
position too, so a return type in front of the body pushes the body along.
Paths never depend on the shape of a sibling, so editing one child moves no
other path.

A closure has no name to insert: ``(fn :i64 ((x :i64)) body)`` is an expression
whose second item is its return type, so it is numbered like any other unnamed
node — the return type is ``.../0``, the parameter list ``.../1`` and the body
``.../2``. Changing the return type from a token to a composite form therefore
moves no path below it.

Paths are assigned once, by ``assign_paths``, immediately after parsing. Later
passes must treat them as read-only, even though ``Node`` itself is mutable.
