"""Compiler diagnostics: one code, one location, one sentence.

Every diagnostic code lives in ``CODES``. Passes import the code they report
instead of spelling a literal, so ``E0001`` cannot mean two different things in
two modules. ``E0001``-``E0006`` are the read-only passes (lexing, parsing,
resolution); ``E01xx`` is the type checker, ``E02xx`` struct fields, ``E03xx``
ownership, ``E04xx`` the string and vector operations, ``E05xx`` generics,
``E06xx`` results and ``E07xx`` concurrency. ``E0700`` is the one the thread
boundary adds: shared mutable state that was not marked ``(shared ...)`` where
it was handed to a thread.

Runtime codes
-------------
A ``R0xxx`` code is not a compiler diagnostic: it is a stable name the C
runtime prints when a program panics at run time, so ``.expect`` tests can
quote it.

* ``R0001`` division by zero — emitted by the lowerer before every ``/`` and
  ``%`` that reaches a zero divisor.
* ``R0002`` double free — raised by the runtime's leak tracker when a block is
  handed back twice. The message is ``double free``; the path is the node that
  allocated the block, because a pointer that has already been released no
  longer names anything. It is exactly that case: a free of an address no
  ``alloc`` ever produced is ``R0004``, not a double free.
* ``R0003`` failed runtime check — emitted by the lowerer for a ``match`` on
  an integer whose arms have no ``_``: an integer match has no static
  exhaustiveness, so the unmatched path panics instead of returning a
  fabricated value. A match over an enum, a result or an optional is proved
  exhaustive by the checker and never reaches this. The same code is emitted for
  an index outside ``0..n`` — of a fixed array, of a vector, or of a string
  slice — for an allocation count or a string length whose byte size would
  overflow, and for an allocation the allocator could not satisfy: all are
  runtime checks that cannot be proven at compile time, and all panic with the
  node path of the operation. It is also the code a ``(cast :iN f)`` emits when
  the float is outside the target's range (``float out of range for :iN``), or
  is a NaN: ``fptosi`` has no defined result there. It is reserved for checks of
  that kind (channel state and the rest).
* ``R0004`` free of a pointer that was never allocated — raised by the same
  tracker when ``rt_free`` is handed an address this process never allocated.
  The location is ``<runtime>``: no ``alloc`` node made the block, so there is
  no node path to name.
* ``R0005`` thread operation failed — a pthread call the runtime could not
  complete: a thread that could not be started, a ``join`` of a handle that is
  not a live thread (including a second join of one already joined), a mutex
  that could not be created, locked or unlocked, or a condition variable that
  failed while a channel was blocking. The location is the node that asked
  (the ``spawn``, the ``join``, the ``lock``, the ``send`` or the ``recv``).

R0002 and R0004 are runtime names only: nothing in the compiler emits them.
A runtime check with no node behind it prints ``<runtime>`` in the location
field, so a panic line always starts with a location.

#: A ``let``/``letmut`` whose name is never read. A binding named ``_`` opts

#: through the binding does not count as a read, so ``letmut`` set and never
#: read is reported too.
UNUSED_BINDING = "E0107"

#: A call to ``main``. The entry point is called by the system with no
#: arguments and an ``:i32`` result, so a program-level call to it would emit a

#: A binding declared outside a loop body was moved or released inside it. The
#: body is checked once, so iteration two would read a slot the first pass
#: emptied: releasing there must happen after the loop instead.
LOOP_MOVE = "E0303"

#: A ``(ref (vec T))`` argument that is not a mutable binding. A ref borrows
#: the caller's descriptor instead of taking it, so the argument must name a
#: ``letmut`` vector or another ref parameter; anything else has no slot the
#: callee may write back through.
REF_ARGUMENT = "E0304"

#: A ref that would outlive the call that received it: returned, stored in a
#: field or a container, held in an enum payload, captured by a closure, or
#: handed to a parameter that is not a ref. A ref is a pointer into the
#: caller's frame, so keeping one would leave every later use pointing at a

#: A type variable that nothing binds: a call whose arguments fix no type for
#: it, or an annotation that names one the enclosing definition never declared.
UNBOUND_TYPE_VAR = "E0501"

#: A closure that captured something leaving the function that created it. The
#: environment lives in the creating frame, so returning the closure, storing
#: it in a field or an element, or keeping it past the iteration that made it
#: would leave a call reading a dead slot.
CLOSURE_ESCAPE = "E0502"

#: A ``match`` whose arms do not name every variant of the enum, result or
#: optional it tests. Unlike an integer match — whose domain no finite arm list
#: covers — these are closed sets, so the fall-through path is statically
#: impossible and the compiler says so instead of emitting a panic.
NON_EXHAUSTIVE = "E0600"

#: A ``try`` that cannot propagate: its operand is not a result, the enclosing
#: function returns no result, or the two error types are not the same enum.
#: There is no error widening, so a different error type has to be mapped
#: explicitly in a ``match``.
TRY_MISMATCH = "E0601"

#: A ``(res T E)`` that is produced and then dropped — a result in statement
#: position, or a binding whose value is never matched, tried, returned or
#: handed to a callee. The whole point of the error slot is that a caller must
#: look at it.
UNHANDLED_RESULT = "E0602"

#: State a thread can change that was not marked ``(shared ...)`` where it
#: crosses to the thread: a raw pointer or a mutex/channel/atomic handle
#: passed to ``spawn``, or an operation on a handle whose declared type is the
#: bare one. The marker exists so a reader can see, at the declaration and at
#: the call, which values two threads may both touch.
SHARED_MARKER = "E0700"

#: The runtime panic code the lowerer emits for a division by zero. ``R0002``
#: double free stays a runtime-only name; the other code the lowerer emits is
#: ``MATCH_NO_ARM``.
DIVISION_BY_ZERO = "R0001"

#: The runtime check an integer ``match`` with no ``_`` arm reaches when no
#: literal matches. An enum, result or optional match is E0600 instead: its
#: variants are a closed set the checker can prove covered.
MATCH_NO_ARM = "R0003"

#: The runtime check an array index outside ``0..n`` reaches. The same code as
#: an unmatched ``match``: both are bounds that only the running program knows.
ARRAY_BOUNDS = "R0003"

#: The runtime check a ``(cast :iN f)`` makes before ``fptosi``/``fptoui``.
#: A float outside the target's range has no integer value, and the LLVM
#: conversion is undefined rather than saturating, so the program panics with
#: ``float out of range for T`` instead of producing one. A NaN takes the same
#: path: neither end of the range test holds for it.
FLOAT_RANGE = "R0003"

#: The runtime code for ``free`` of an address no ``alloc`` produced. Like
#: ``R0002`` it is a runtime name only; the compiler never emits it, and the
#: location it prints is ``<runtime>`` because no node allocated the block.
