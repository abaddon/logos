"""Build Logos programs: front end, IR, clang.

The driver is the only part of the compiler that writes into ``build/`` and the
only part that runs another process. It owns two paths, and both are anchored
to the repository rather than to the caller's working directory, so a build
works the same from the root of the tree, from a test, or from anywhere else:

* the IR of a source file, ``build/<name>.ll``, kept on disk because it is the
  artefact a person reads when a program misbehaves;
* the C runtime, ``logos/runtime/rt.c``, linked into every binary.

The link is one clang invocation::

    clang {opt} -target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu build/<name>.ll logos/runtime/rt.c
          -o <out> -lpthread -lm

clang compiles the IR text and ``rt.c``, then links both with libc. There are no
LLVM bindings, no ``llc`` and no ``lld`` in this pipeline; the IR text is the
whole interface.
