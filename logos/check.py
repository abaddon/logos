"""The type checker: one resolved module in, one checked module out.

Scope
-----
This pass checks what the language has so far: primitives, arithmetic,
comparisons, ``and``/``or``/``not``, ``let``/``letmut``/``set``, ``if``,
``while``, ``match``, ``break``/``continue``, ``ret``, calls, struct field
access, fixed arrays, manual memory, strings, growable vectors, results,
optionals, enums, and threads with their synchronization. ``print`` and
``println`` are the built-in functions: each takes one value and writes it,
formatted by the runtime.
value is any scalar with a formatter of its own — ``:i64``, ``:u64``,
``:f64``, ``:bool``, ``:str`` — and nothing is converted to reach one, so a
``:i32`` is a type mismatch and not an implicit widening.

Strings and vectors
-------------------
``:str`` is a fat pointer of bytes: ``(str-len s)`` is its byte count,
``(str-concat a b)`` builds a new one, ``(str-slice s start end)`` is the bytes
of ``[start, end)``, ``(str-eq a b)`` is byte equality — the same answer
``=`` gives, because ``=`` accepts ``:str`` too — and ``(read-all)`` returns
everything on standard input as one of those strings, in a buffer that owns
nothing and never appears in the leak report. ``(vec T)`` is a growable
array: it starts empty at ``(make (vec T))``, grows with ``(vec-push v x)``,
reads with ``(vec-len v)`` and ``(vec-get v i)``, and releases its buffer with
``(vec-free v)``. The mutating forms — push, set, free — take a name, because
they rewrite the three-word descriptor that lives in its slot, exactly as
``arr-set`` rewrites the array in its own slot: a ``letmut`` binding, or a
parameter, which the callee owns outright. A parameter is a place for these
three forms and not for ``set``, which still needs ``letmut``. An index that
is not an integer is E0400 and a string operand that is not a ``:str`` is
E0401. That E0401 rule belongs to the ``str-*`` forms the compiler has always
had; the forms added for the self-hosted compiler (``read-file``, ``args``,
``str-byte``, ``str-from-i64``, ``f64-bits``) report a wrong argument of any
kind as E0100 at that argument instead.

A parameter may be spelled ``(ref (vec T))``: the callee receives the address
of the caller's descriptor, so a push, set or free inside it acts on the
caller's vector and nothing is copied or moved. The argument must be a
``letmut`` binding or another ref parameter (E0304, ``a ref argument must be a
mutable binding``), and a ref may not leave the call: returning it, storing it
in a field, an element or an enum payload, capturing it, allocating a block of
it, or passing it to a parameter that is not a ref is E0305, ``a ref cannot
escape the call``. Every container form reads a ref as the vector it names, so
``vec-len`` and ``vec-get`` work through one too; ``set`` and ``set-field``
keep refusing any parameter, ref or not (E0104).

A ``(vec T)`` owns the buffer its descriptor names, so a value that contains one
is never copied: binding it to a second name, setting one, passing it as an
argument, or pushing it into another vector moves it, and the source is empty
afterwards (a later read is E0300). A
second transfer of the same value is **E0402** — there is one buffer and no rule
that would let two names share it. For the same reason a vector may not be a
struct field or a fixed-array element yet: releasing it needs a place expression,
and a field is not one, so such a field would leak by construction. Both are
**E0002** where the type is spelled.

Memory and ownership
--------------------
``(alloc T n)`` has type ``(own T)``: a block of n elements the program must
release with ``(free p)``. Only a type whose every bit pattern is already a
value may be allocated, because the block is not initialised: a scalar, a
``:bool``, a struct of those, or an array of those. A ``(vec T)``, a
``(res ...)``, an enum, a ``(fn ...)``, a ``:str`` and any type that holds an
owner are **E0002**, ``allocation of T is not supported: it has invariants``:
reading one of those uninitialised is a branch on a garbage tag or a call
through a garbage pointer. ``(ptr p)`` gives the same address as a raw
``(ptr T)``, which may be walked with ``(ptr-add p i)`` and read or written
with ``(deref p)``/``(set-deref p v)``; only the owner may free, so a raw
pointer is E0301 there.

An owning value is not copied, it moves: into a binding, into a call's
``(own T)`` parameter, out of a ``ret``, or through ``free``. The binding left
behind holds nothing, and reading it is E0300 — which is what makes a double
free a compile error in the direct case. A move is only legal out of a
``letmut`` or a parameter (E0302): a plain ``let`` promised to hold the same
value for its whole scope, while ``free`` destroys the value rather than
transferring it and so is allowed on any owning binding.

A loop body is checked once, so it may not empty a binding declared outside
it: ``(free p)`` or any move of ``p`` inside ``while`` is **E0303**, ``a
binding declared outside a loop cannot be released or moved inside it``.
Iteration two would read what iteration one released. Only a binding declared
inside the body may be released there; anything else is released after the
loop. The same holds for ``(vec-free v)``.

An owner lives only in a direct binding or a function parameter. It may not be
stored in a struct field, a fixed-array element or an enum payload, and an
owner may not hold another (E0002 where the type is spelled): a place has no
way to move it out, so the owner would either be copied or leak. Neither may a
container hold one: a `(vec T)` or `(arr T n)` whose element type holds an
owner at any depth is E0002, `a container of owners is not supported yet`,
where the container is spelled, because an element can be neither read nor
released and the program would leak by construction. For the same
reason no expression may *read* one out of a place — ``(get b p)`` where the
field is an owner, ``(arr-get a i)``, ``(vec-get v i)`` and ``(deref p)`` of an
owning pointer are **E0402**, ``an owner cannot be read out of a place yet``:
a read copies the pointer, which is the second owner the whole rule exists to
prevent. The rule is not owner-specific: a ``(vec T)`` read out of a place
copies its descriptor the same way, so ``(vec-get v i)``, ``(arr-get a i)``,
``(get b f)`` and ``(deref p)`` are E0402 whenever the place's type is
move-only, with ``a vector cannot be read out of a place yet`` naming the
reason.

A type that *contains* an owner by value — ``(opt (own T))``, ``(res (own T)
E)`` — has no copy either, so binding
it, passing it, returning it or storing it in any construction moves it, and
that move needs no ``letmut`` for the same reason a vector's does not: the
binding is emptied, not reused. A ``match`` consumes a scrutinee that owns
something because its arm binds the payload, and a second transfer is E0402.
Moves are tracked per binding and conservatively across branches: each
``if`` branch, ``while`` body and ``match`` arm is checked from the ownership
state as it was before the first branch, so one branch's move cannot make a
sibling's use illegal. At the join a name counts as moved if *any* branch moved
it, because the alternative would accept a second free on the path that did.
``set`` does not re-arm a moved binding: assigning to one is E0300, since one
path may already have released the old value and no path-local assignment can
be trusted to have replaced it. A copy the checker cannot see — through an
aggregate, or from C — is what the runtime's double-free panic is for.

Structs and fixed arrays
------------------------
``(type point (struct (x :i64) (y :i64)))`` introduces a struct whose fields
are read once, in declaration order, by :func:`struct_shape`. ``(make T v...)``
builds a struct or an array and checks one value per field or element;
``(get e f)`` reads a field at its own type; ``(set-field name f v)`` and
``(arr-set name i v)`` mutate a binding and therefore need a ``letmut``.
``(arr-get a i)`` reads an element; its index must be an integer and its bounds
are checked at run time. An unknown field is E0200 and a value that does not
fit its field is E0201.

Control flow
------------
``if`` is an expression: both branches must have the same type and that type is
the ``if``'s. ``while`` is a statement. ``match`` is an expression over an
integer, an enum, a result or an optional, and its arms are ``(pattern
body...)``; an integer pattern is a literal or ``_``, and a variant pattern is
the variant's name or ``(variant binding)``. Every arm must have the same type,
and the last item of a body is the arm's value. An integer match needs no
``_`` — its domain is not enumerable — while the other three are closed sets
and must name every variant (E0600). ``break`` and ``continue`` are statements
with no operand and are only legal inside a loop, which this pass tracks as a
depth on the enclosing environment: a closure starts at zero, because it is
not inside the loop that lexically contains it.

Concurrency
-----------
``(spawn f args...)`` starts ``f`` on a thread and returns ``:thread``; ``f``
is a module function returning ``:void`` and its arguments are copied into the
new thread, so a value that owns memory is E0402. A raw pointer or a handle
crosses only under ``(shared ...)``, which is E0700 when it is missing. A
``:thread`` handle is one of those handles: ``join`` releases it, so two
threads holding one address could join it twice, and passing one to ``spawn``
needs ``(shared :thread)`` to say so.
``(join t)`` waits and uses the handle up.

``(mutex)`` gives a ``(shared :mutex)``, which ``lock``/``unlock`` take;
``(chan T n)`` gives a ``(shared (chan T))``, which ``send``/``recv`` use;
``(atomic T v)`` gives a ``(shared (atomic T))`` for ``:i64`` or ``:u64``. The
three handles are only spellable behind the shared marker, and the marker wraps
nothing but a pointer or one of them: ``(shared (ptr T))`` is the marked
address a thread may be handed, and ``deref``/``set-deref``/``ptr-add`` accept
it. A channel copies its elements, so a vector or an owner element is refused;
``spawn`` likewise refuses a move-only argument.

Purity
------
``check_module`` reads a ``Module`` and returns a new ``CheckedModule``. It
does not write to the tree, does not touch the filesystem, and makes no choice
that depends on anything but the module's contents: a second call over the same
module returns an equal result. Every diagnostic it raises carries the path of
the node that caused it, so ``LogosError.render`` never has to fall back to a
bare message.

Two passes
----------
Every signature is built before any body is checked. A module's own functions
and the functions of its direct imports therefore all have a type by the time a
call is checked, which makes source order irrelevant: a function can call one
defined later. Because imports are not merged into ``Module.fns``, walking
``Module.imports`` is what builds the visible namespace, and a caller sees the
definitions of the modules it names, never the ones they name. A call to a
function whose **declaring module** is not part of the build is **E0103**,
``imported functions are not lowered yet: 'name'``, at the call:
``check_program`` names the build set, because those modules share one object
file, and a module checked alone lowers only its own definitions. A generic
declared elsewhere is never instantiated in the caller's namespace, so a call
to one is the same E0103 however large the build set is.

Reserved names
--------------
A ``fn`` or ``type`` name that a form already spells is **E0003**, ``reserved
form name``. The form wins — ``(get ...)`` is always the field read — so a
definition of that name could never be called. The list is the forms plus the
``vec-``, ``str-``, ``arr-`` and ``atomic-`` families; ``allocator`` and
``get-value`` are not the forms themselves and stay legal.

What a binding is
-----------------
Bindings are block-scoped. A ``let``/``letmut`` is visible only inside the
block that declares it: a function body, an ``if`` branch, a ``while`` body or
a ``match`` arm. Reading the name outside that block is E0005. The function's
parameters form its outermost block, so a second binding of one name in that
same block is a duplicate, while a nested block may shadow an outer binding.
Parameters are immutable; only ``letmut`` allows ``set``.

Literals
--------
A numeric literal has no intrinsic width: it takes the type it is checked
against when that type is a matching primitive (an integer literal against an
integer type, a float literal against a float type) and falls back to ``:i64``
or ``:f64`` otherwise. A literal beside a non-literal operand looks ahead to
that operand's type, in arithmetic and in comparisons, so ``(< 1 a)`` with
``a :u8`` checks as ``:u8``. This is not a conversion: nothing is cast at run
time, and a value that already has a type never changes under ``compatible``.
The adopted type is also the literal's range: an integer literal that does not
fit its resolved type is E0106, never a silent truncation.

Numbers, bits and casts
-----------------------
Arithmetic (``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``) and every comparison work on both the
integer and the float widths. An operation mixes no widths and no kinds: a float
beside an integer is E0100, because the language has no implicit conversion and
the checker will not invent one. ``%`` is integers only — a float remainder
would have to choose between C's ``fmod`` and IEEE's remainder — and the backend
says the same thing, so a form that checks is a form that lowers.

``(shl a n)``, ``(shr a n)`` and ``(shr-u a n)`` shift an integer's bits: left,
arithmetic right (the sign bit fills) and logical right (zeros fill). The
shifted value fixes the type and the count is checked against it like any other
operand; a count at or past the width is legal and is masked to the width, the
way the hardware does, so ``(shl x 64)`` on an ``:i64`` is ``(shl x 0)``.
Shifting a float or a ``:bool`` is E0100.

``(cast T e)`` is the one explicit conversion. It is numeric only and must
change the type: a cast that names the operand's own type is E0100, and so is
one that names ``:bool``, ``:str``, a struct, an enum or a container, at either
end. Integer widths truncate or extend, an integer becomes a float with IEEE
rounding, and a float outside the target's range panics ``R0003`` at run time
rather than producing the undefined answer an ``fptosi`` would.

Returning
---------
A function whose declared return type is not ``:void`` must end every path in
a ``ret``; a path that falls off the end is E0105. Presence is not enough: an
``if`` terminates only when both arms do, a ``match`` when every arm does, and
a ``while`` whose condition is the literal ``true`` terminates unless its body
can ``break`` out. ``main`` is held to the same rule when it returns ``:i64``:
an exit status nobody wrote must not become 0. A test is ``:void`` by
construction and needs none.

Tests
-----
Test bodies are checked too, because they are ordinary grammar. ``expect`` and
``expect-leak`` are harness directives, not expressions, so their children are
left alone. A helper ``fn`` inside a test is **E0002**, ``test-local helper
functions are not lowered yet``: no symbol is emitted for one, so a call could
never link, and the refusal is at the node rather than at the call.

Generics
--------
A single capital letter in a signature is a type variable, and a definition
whose signature mentions one is generic:
``(fn map :(vec U) ((a :(vec T)) (f :(fn (T) U))) ...)`` is a function of two
type parameters, read off the signature in the order they first appear.
Nothing is checked inside a generic body until a call fixes its variables: a
call unifies each parameter with the argument beside it, and the copy that
results is checked once per concrete instantiation (monomorphisation). The
copy's name spells its type arguments, ``map$i64$i64``, so two instantiations
of one source function never share a symbol.

Instantiations are discovered by a worklist over call sites, not by recursion
through the checker: a call records what it needs and the body is checked after
the enclosing body finishes, so a generic that calls another generic — or
itself — terminates on the memo key ``(name, type arguments)``. 256 distinct
copies is the ceiling (E0500), and a type variable that no argument binds is
E0501: at the call that cannot fix it, or at an annotation that names a
variable the enclosing definition never declared.

Results and optionals
---------------------
``(res T E)`` is a value of two variants, ``(ok v)`` and ``(err e)``, and
``(opt T)`` is ``(some v)`` or ``(none)``. The error slot names a *declared
enum* — ``(type parse-error (enum (bad-digit :u64) (overflow)))`` — and nothing
else, because ``try`` needs one identity to compare; any other error type is
E0101 where the result is spelled. An enum is a closed set of named variants,
each with no payload (``overflow``) or one (``(bad-digit :u64)``); a variant is
built by its bare name, ``(bad-digit 5)``, and matched by name, ``(bad-digit
n)`` or ``overflow``.

``(ok v)`` and ``(err e)`` take the result type the context expects — a
``ret``'s return type or a ``let``'s annotation — because nothing else could
choose the error enum; without one they are E0100. ``(some v)`` infers its
element from ``v`` and ``(none)`` needs the annotation. ``(try e)`` yields the
ok value of a result, and propagates the error by ``ret``ing it from the
enclosing function: the function must return a result whose error type is
exactly ``e``'s, or the ``try`` is E0601. There is no widening and no union.

A result is an obligation: somebody has to look at its error slot. A ``match``
over one must handle ``ok`` and ``err`` (or a ``_``), a match over an enum must
name every variant, and a match over an optional must handle ``some`` and
``none`` — a missing one is E0600. A result in statement position, or a
binding never matched, tried, returned or handed to a callee, is E0602. The
obligation follows the value through a copy, a capture, a ``ret`` and a call
argument; ``set`` gives the binding a new one. Discharging it is not
path-sensitive — handling a result inside one branch of an ``if`` is enough —
because the question this answers is "was it looked at", not "was it looked at
on every path". A result may not be stored in an aggregate — a struct field, an
array or vector element, an enum payload, another result or an optional — until
a place expression can carry the obligation with it: E0002 where the storage is
spelled, and E0602 for a result handed to ``(ok ...)`` or ``(some ...)``, which
would hide it one level down. Vectors that a tagged value would have to copy
are refused (E0402) for the same reason a vector may not be a struct field.

Closures
--------
``(fn :R ((p :T)...) body...)`` is a value of type ``(fn (T) R)``: the same
signature spelling as a definition, without the name. It captures by value
every outer binding its body reads, and the checker records that list so the
lowerer can build the environment. Capturing copies, so an owning value — an
``(own T)`` or anything holding a ``(vec T)`` — is refused: its environment has
no single owner to release it. A captured name is a fresh, immutable binding
inside the closure, which is why ``set`` on one is E0104 and why a change to
the outer binding after the closure was made is invisible to it.

A captured value is copied into the frame that created the closure, not onto
the heap: the language allocates nothing the source did not spell. That frame
is therefore the closure's lifetime, and the checker enforces it where a value
could leave: returning a capturing closure, storing it in a struct field or an
array element, pushing it into a vector, passing it to another function, or
keeping it past the loop iteration that made it is E0502. The function type
records which kind it is — ``(fn (T) R)`` is an ordinary function pointer,
``(fn* (T) R)`` a closure that captured — and the two are not compatible, so a
plain function-typed parameter can never receive one. Binding a capturing
closure to a local name and calling it in the frame that made it is what is
left, and what a capture is for. A closure that captures nothing is a plain
function pointer and may escape freely.

    """One binding: its type, and what the checker knows about its value.

    ``moved`` is the ownership state of an owning binding — an ``(own T)`` or a
    value that contains a ``(vec T)``: once its value has been transferred or
    released, the binding holds nothing and any read of it is E0300.
    ``param`` records that the name arrived as a parameter, which
    the callee owns outright — a parameter may be moved on, while a plain
    ``let`` needs ``letmut`` before its value can be transferred (E0302).

    ``decl_loop`` is how many loops enclosed the declaration and
    ``origin_loop`` how many enclosed the value now stored. They differ only
    for a capturing closure: one made inside a loop and stored in a binding
    declared outside it would outlive its iteration, when the environment slot
    is overwritten by the next pass (E0502). ``decl_loop`` is also what refuses
    a move inside a loop of a binding declared outside it (E0303): the body is
    checked once, so the second pass would read what the first released.

    ``ref`` records that the binding is a ``(ref (vec T))`` parameter: it holds
    an address rather than a value. A ref passes the mutability test of the
    container forms because the callee is meant to write through it, but it
    may never be moved, stored or captured — every one of those would outlive
    the call that lent it (E0305).

    ``handled`` is the obligation a ``(res T E)`` carries: the value was made,
    so somebody has to look at its error slot. ``match``, ``try``, ``ret`` and
    handing it to a callee all discharge it; letting the block that declared it
    end first is E0602 at ``path``. ``path`` is the binding's own node, so the
    diagnostic points at the declaration and not at the block that ends.

    ``used`` records that a read reached this binding. A write does not set it
    — ``set``, ``set-field`` and ``arr-set`` write through a name without
    reading its value — which is what makes a ``letmut`` that is only ever
    assigned E0107. A parameter is never reported, because its name belongs to
    the signature rather than to the body.

    Bindings live in a stack of block scopes, innermost last. The first scope

    its own. A name is looked up from the innermost scope outwards, so a
    nested block may shadow an outer binding, and a name declared inside a
    block is gone when that block ends. That is what keeps a read after a join
    from reaching a slot the branch never stored: scope, not liveness, decides
    visibility.

    ``outer`` is set on a closure's environment. A name the closure's own
    scopes do not hold is looked up there, and finding one *captures* it: the
    closure gets a fresh copy of the binding, and the capture list grows by
    that name. A copy is what makes capture by value visible in the types —
    the closure may read the name for as long as it exists, but nothing it does
