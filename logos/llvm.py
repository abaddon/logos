"""Print an :class:`logos.ir.IrModule` as LLVM IR text.

The text is the interface to clang: nothing here links or optimises, it only
spells the IR the way LLVM 14 reads it. One function owns that spelling, so a
change in how a type or an operand prints happens in one place.

Typed pointers, not ``ptr``
--------------------------
LLVM 14 parses ``ptr`` only in its experimental ``-opaque-pointers`` mode: give
clang 14 a module that says ``ptr`` and it answers "ptr type is only supported
in -opaque-pointers mode / expected type". This emitter therefore spells
pointers the way clang 14 spells them, as ``i8*`` at the C boundary and
``[N x i8]*`` for a string global. Nothing here needs a pointer's element type
to be known, which is why the boundary is enough.

Strings
-------
A string global is an array of exactly its own bytes — no NUL terminator,
because a Logos string carries its length and ``rt_write`` is handed that
length. Every byte outside printable ASCII is escaped as ``\\XX``, so a string
containing a quote, a backslash or a newline round-trips.

Symbols
-------
A function is printed at ``fn.symbol`` when it has one (the lowerer mangles a
program function to ``lg.<module>.<name>``) and with ``internal`` linkage when
``fn.internal`` is set; ``main`` keeps its name and external linkage. A name
LLVM does not read unquoted is printed as a quoted identifier, so no source
name and no module name can produce text clang refuses.

Structs
-------
A named struct is an LLVM identified type, ``%struct.<name>``, defined once at
the top of the module as its fields in declaration order:
``%struct.pair = type { i8, i64 }``. That order is what gives the aggregate C
layout: LLVM lays identified structs out like C, with natural alignment and
padding between fields, so the same declaration is 16 bytes here and 16 in C.
Nothing here reorders or packs fields. An array is ``[n x T]``, which is also
C's layout for the same bytes.

    backend stores. ``T`` still has to have a layout of its own, so the walk
    that refuses an unlowered type descends through both before asking here.

    A ``(vec T)`` is three words in a literal struct, ``{ T*, i64, i64 }``:
    the buffer, its length in elements and its capacity in elements. It is
    spelled as a literal rather than an identified struct so two vectors of
    different elements cannot share a name, and so the layout is read off the
    type itself with no registry to keep in step. A ``(fn (T) R)`` is the same
    kind of literal: two words, the environment pointer and the code pointer,
    both opaque, so any two function values are one layout whatever they take
    and return. The code pointer's real type is spelled only where it is called.

    A ``(res T E)`` is ``{ i1, T, E }`` and a ``(opt T)`` is ``{ i1, T }``:
    the tag first, then one slot per variant, the slot a variant does not use
    left ``undef``. The tag is a real ``i1`` rather than a byte so a result
    and an optional with the same payload are the same size.

    An enum is ``{ i32, [K x i64] }`` — a tag and a payload area wide enough
    for the largest variant, so one type holds every variant. ``K`` is the
    enum's, not the value's, and the lowerer registers it by name: that is what
    keeps two enums of different shapes apart while letting every value of one
    enum be one LLVM type.
