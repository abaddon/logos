# Logos

Logos is a prefix-form language built for AI readers, with `logosc`, a compiler
that turns Logos source into native x86_64 Linux binaries.

The design goal is that a model can read and write the language without
guessing. There is no implicit conversion, no hidden allocation, no hidden
global state and no silent error swallowing. A call that allocates shows it. A
call that can fail declares it. Release is manual through `free`.

The compiler front end is Python, standard library only: lexer, parser,
resolver and type checker lower a typed syntax tree to a small flat IR, which is
printed as LLVM IR text. `clang` compiles that text and links it against the C
runtime in `logos/runtime/`.

## Learn it

Start with `docs/LOGOS.md`: one dense reference, cheat sheet first, then one
complete executable chapter per feature in learning order. It is generated from
the compiler's own tables and every example is run by the test harness at `-O0`
and `-O2`, so it cannot drift from the implementation.

- `docs/LOGOS.md` — the manual, generated; do not edit it by hand.
- `logosc guide --json` — the machine-readable manifest: forms, types,
  operators, builtins, reserved names, diagnostic codes and test categories.
- `logosc guide --check` — proves the committed manual is current; exits 1 with
  a diff summary when it is stale.
- `docs/manual/` — the numbered chapter sources the manual embeds.

Regenerate after changing the compiler with `logosc guide > docs/LOGOS.md`.

## Status

Logos v1 is complete for one target: x86_64 Linux. The language, the compiler
and the test harness are built, reviewed, and green.

Verified by execution on this machine:

- `python3 -m logos test` runs 184 cases across eight categories at `-O0` and
  `-O2` and compares the two optimisation levels with each other, not only with
  the expected output. 0 failures, 10 deliberate leaks, 0 baseline regressions.
- `bash tools/accept.sh` runs seven sections and all pass: the harness, a
  differential oracle against gcc, three example programs whose output matches
  `wc`, `jq` and a C reference byte for byte, formatter idempotency over 41
  files, and a compile-speed floor.
- 851 unit tests pass. `tools/verify_install.sh` installs the package into a
  throwaway prefix and builds a program from outside the repository.

The language has: integers, floats, booleans and strings; structs with C
layout; fixed arrays and growable vectors; enums with payloads; results and
optionals with `try`; generics by monomorphisation; closures confined to their
frame; manual memory with move checking and a leak tracker; threads, mutexes,
channels and atomics over pthreads; `extern` declarations for the C ABI; and
node-addressed tooling (`show`, `patch`, `fmt`) that treats one subtree as one
editable unit.

### What it refuses, on purpose

These are not gaps. Each one exists because the alternative was a program that
reads freed memory, uses an uninitialised value, or behaves differently at
`-O2` than at `-O0`:

- a vector, an owner, or any type containing one is never copied; binding it
  moves it, and a second use is E0300 or E0402;
- a value cannot be read out of a place (a vector element, an array element, a
  struct field, a dereference) when its type owns memory;
- an owner may not be stored in a struct, an array, an enum payload or another
  owner, so aggregate copies can never duplicate one;
- a binding declared outside a loop may not be moved or freed inside it,
  condition included;
- a capturing closure may not cross a call boundary; its environment lives in
  the creating frame;
- `alloc` refuses any type with an invariant (a vector, a result, an optional,
  a function value, a string, an enum tag), so nothing uninitialised is ever
  read as a typed value;
- a result that is never handled is an error, and `try` requires the exact
  error type;
- shared state must be marked `(shared T)` before it can reach another thread,
  and the marker is checked through aggregates;
- a form the checker accepts but the backend cannot emit is a bug; the backend
  never fails silently at run time.

### Known limits

- One target: x86_64 Linux. The target triple is a flag, but arm64 and Darwin
  have not been built or tested.
- Release builds do not quarantine freed blocks, so `R0002` in a release build
  is defence in depth. A stale double free cannot be constructed from Logos
  source, because the ownership rules above refuse it.
- Imports resolve at check time but only own-module functions are lowered, so a
  cross-module call is refused until linking exists. Test-local helper
  functions are refused for the same reason.
- A `:str` owns nothing: concatenation allocates a buffer that lives until the
  process exits, and it does not appear in the leak report.
- A mutex held by a thread that exited stays locked; an unjoined thread's
  allocations may or may not appear in the leak report.
- `examples/wc.logos` matches GNU `wc` through a pipe, which pads to seven
  columns; a regular-file redirect uses a different width.


## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04, x86_64
- Python 3.10 or newer (3.10.12 ships with Ubuntu 22.04; 3.14 also works)
- clang 14 and lld: `apt-get install -y clang lld` (`lld` is unused so far;
  clang links through the system linker)
- gcc 11 and jq 1.6 for `tools/accept.sh`: gcc builds the differential oracle's
  C twins, jq is the JSON example's reference
- GNU make

## Usage

```sh
python3 -m logos version                      # logos 0.1.0
python3 -m logos build examples/hello.logos   # build/hello, and build/hello.ll
./build/hello                                 # hello
python3 -m logos guide                        # the generated manual
python3 -m logos guide --json                 # the machine-readable manifest
python3 -m logos guide --check                # fail if docs/LOGOS.md is stale
python3 -m logos test                         # run the directive-driven corpus
python3 -m logos test --only exec --opt -O0   # one category, one optimisation level
bash tools/accept.sh                          # corpus, gcc oracle, examples, fmt
```

`logosc test` reads the `(expect ...)` directive in each `(test ...)` node and
the module-level `(expect-error E0xxx)` of a negative case, runs every case at
`-O0` and `-O2`, and writes to `tests/summary.txt` with `--update-baseline`.
The baseline records the optimisation levels it ran (`OPTS -O0 -O2`), one line
per case and the suite's leak total; a case that passed in the baseline and
fails now is a regression and exits 1, as is a full run that leaks more than
the baseline recorded at the same levels. A baseline that has no `OPTS` line
cannot be compared and is refused with a request to regenerate it, rather than
silently leaving the leak total ungated. `--update-baseline` with `--only`
merges: it rewrites the cases it ran, drops the ones the category no longer
contains, and keeps the rest. A `.logos` file outside the known categories
(`parse`, `type`, `exec`, `mem`, `thread`, `generics`, `regress`, `diff`) is
reported and fails the run rather than being skipped.

`tools/accept.sh` is the end-to-end gate: the corpus, `tests/diff/run_diff.sh`
(Logos against gcc at `-O0` and `-O2`, floored by `tests/diff/manifest.txt`),
the three example programs against `wc`, `jq` and a C reference build,
`logosc fmt` idempotency over every `.logos` file in the tree, and a generated
200-function program with structs, a generic and a thread that must compile in
under five seconds. A section that examined zero items is a failure, and the
script exits 0 only when all seven sections print PASS.

The IR is always kept beside the binary under `build/`: it is the artefact to
read when a compiled program misbehaves.

## Examples

| Program | What it does | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `examples/wc.logos` | counts lines, words and bytes from standard input | `wc -c -w -l` |
| `examples/json.logos` | parses JSON and prints a structural summary | `jq` |
| `examples/matrix.logos` | multiplies two 200x200 matrices on four threads | `examples/matrix_ref.c` |

`wc` reads through `(read-all)` and prints GNU wc's three seven-wide columns in
GNU's order: lines, words, bytes. It splits words on the same set GNU does:
ASCII space and the C-locale controls, then the UTF-8 space separators
(U+00A0, U+1680, U+2000 to U+200A, U+202F, U+205F, U+3000); U+2028 and U+2029
are line and paragraph separators, not spaces, and GNU wc does not split there
either. `json` is a recursive-descent parser over `(res :i64 json-error)` that
validates every value, including string escapes and number grammar, counts
objects, arrays, members, scalars and nesting depth, and resolves duplicate
keys the way jq does (the last member wins). `matrix` fills two matrices from a
fixed integer pattern, hands each of four threads fifty rows through
`(shared (ptr :i64))`, and prints a checksum, a weighted checksum, the centre
cell and the last cell. `examples/sample.json` is the JSON fixture the
acceptance script feeds to both the program and jq; `examples/inputs/` holds
the Unicode word-separator inputs and the duplicate-key and malformed JSON
documents the script also compares.

## Development

```sh
make test    # python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v

Read `AGENTS.md` first if you are an AI agent, or `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you are a
person; `tools/pr_gate.sh` runs every gate a pull request must pass. The
repository accepts pull requests from humans and from AI agents acting through
their operator's account. Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by` trailer that
matches its author: `tools/pr_gate.sh` checks that first, and stops before any
gate if it fails.
